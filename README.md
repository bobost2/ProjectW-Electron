# What is "Project W"
A codename for a project that has no name. The goal of this project is to create a stationary bike computer that tracks the workout statistics.
It's currently split into two repositories - Arduino and Electron

# What is included in this repository
This app processes the information from the Arduino and then visualizes it using the framework [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/). 
The base for this project is [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

Also this repository previously existed as a private one in [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but now I have moved it to GitHub.
